## Time
I started this assignment in 5 days which it took me 3-5 hours per day.
__ The problems came up during the process:
    1. Finding the images for the website
    2. RSS feeds, the google api has shut down the function convert RSS file, it took time for me to figure out another solution
    3. Boostrap 4 has a bit different from the version 3 __
